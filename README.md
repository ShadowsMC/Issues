# ShadowsMC Issue Tracker

The repository that contains all issues regarding anything ShadowsMC.
_No, none of the ShadowsMCs internals are open source._

## Proper Issue Creation

### 1. **Describe your issue**

Describe the issue that you experienced. What would were you expecting to happen when you experienced the issue? What actually happened? Where did you experience this issue?

### 2. **Describe how to reproduce**

Provide steps on how one of the Developers or one of our Issue Moderators to reproduce the issue. If we're unable to replicate the issue we may request that you attempt to cause the issue again and record it.

### 3. **Describe the success rate**

Should you experience an issue we ask that you attempt to recreate the issue multiple times (a minimum of 3, a maximum of 10), having a higher success rate may move the issue up in terms of priority. If a developer or issue moderator is unable to replicate the issue you've encountered the issue will likely be "put on the back burner."
